## LOG: #001

## Jan 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I started my moring off by uploading a JavaScript Tester program I wrote yesterday and then created a README bio in GitHub for my profile. I then created and formatted this log as a way to journal and track my progress. I wish I had started it sooner.

Zero to Mastery (ZTM) Course: Learning about Document Object Model (DOM): When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard. The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

<h2>Learned about</h2> 

DOM Selectors
--------------
getElementsByTagName
getElementsByClassName
getElementById

querySelector
querySelectorAll

getAttribute
setAttribute

##Changing Styles
style.{property} //ok

className //best
classList //best

classList.add
classList.remove
classList.toggle

##Bonus
innerHTML //DANGEROUS

parentElement
children

##It is important to CACHE selectors in variables

##CODE: How to make parent elements contorl ( > * )
#parent > * {
    display: block;
    margin: 30px 0;
}

##CODE: how to force first letter to uppercase
textBox.value = textBox.value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + textBox.value.slice(1).toLowerCase();

Made a simple shopping list maker with DOM and JavaSript.
**Thoughts**: 
Using DOM and JavaScript is exacltly what I was looking for in learning how to mimic making a To-Do list program with Flask. There are a lot of possibilites with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I'm eager to get more involved. I have some ideas for projects using this system.
